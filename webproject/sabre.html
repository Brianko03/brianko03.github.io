    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Sabre is another form of fencing which is very unique from the other two, because it is possible to hit with the side of the blade as well as the tip. Épée and foil can only hit valid targets with the point, but it is possible to slash in sabre, which makes it a very fast sport. The blade has a unique handle that allows you to almost hold it perpendicular to the floor, whereas foil and épée grips are favorable to hold it parallel. Sabre also incorporates right of way, just like foil, in the very fast paced bout.</p>
    
  <h2>Weapon</h2>

  </div>
  <p>The blade itself is a very stiff alloy, because sabre is not meant to use moves such as flicks or any moves that require the bending of the blade. Sabre requires the blade to slash the opponent, and also be able to endure hard hits from the opponent's raging attack as well. In order for this to happen, the blade cannot be weak, because it will break easily. The blade is designed to indicate when the blade gets on contact with the other person's láme, which means you can use both stabbing and slashing.</p>
  <h2>Rules</h2>
  <p>Sabre is another form that incorporates the right of way. A sabre action has three possible outcomes. Either one of the scoring lights turns on, both turn on, or the referee stops the action before either turns on. Referees have to be stricter in sabre than foil, because of the fast movement, which is in need for very picky calls. If a fencer does even a miniscule thing wrong, then he/she may lose the entire point. Sabre fencers must be very agile, for they need to be able to block all of the incoming attacks as well as attack with nimbleness that surpasses the other person. It is the sport that requires the most speed and reflexes.</p>
  <h3>Target Area</h3>
  <div id="image">
    <img src="https://brianko03.github.io/images/sabretargets.png" alt="Sabre Targets" style="width:400px;height:auto">
  </div>
  <p>The target area for the sabre consists of the torso above the waist, as well as the arms and head (excluding both hands). When fencing with electric equipment, a manchette, or sabre cuff, is used in conjunction with the lamé and electrically conductive mask to ensure that the entire target area forms a single circuit.
  <br>
  <br>
Because touches can be scored using the edge of the blade, there is no need for a pressure-sensitive head to be present on the end of the blade (thus having the button). When fencing "electric" (as opposed to "steam" or "dry") a current runs through the sabre blade. When the blade comes into contact with the lamé, the electrical mask, or the manchette, the current flows through the body cord and interacts with the scoring equipment.</p>
  <h3>Lockout</h3>
  <p>A lockout is when only one of the scoring lights turns on even though both fencers have hit each other. This occurs because the scoring apparatus measures the time between the earlier fencer's hit and the later fencer's hit and if the time delay is over a prescribed threshold, the later fencer's hit is not registered.
  <br>
  <br>
The lockout time for the sabre was originally 300 to 350 milliseconds (varying by the reliability of the machine used). In 2005, however, the FIE voted 51-33 to decrease the lockout time. They then proceeded to vote 50-32 to decrease it to the specified time of approximately 120 milliseconds. Following the completion of the 2016 Olympic Games, the timing was increased to 170 milliseconds.
<br>
<br>
Changing the lockout timing effectively changed the way with which the sabre was fenced, making it faster with greater emphasis on footwork. Although the essential nature of the game would remain the same, the strategies for attack and defense would need to be rethought.
<br>
<br>
The timing change was initially greeted with a degree of controversy, as many fencers were accustomed to having the longer timings. This made the techniques then employed vulnerable to fast stop-cuts (a hit made by the defender that lands whilst the attacker is still beginning an attack, also known as a skyhook) or remises (a second attack made by the original attacker after the first has technically finished). It was commonly regarded that the shorter timings would only encourage poor technique and an "attack only" mentality, negating much of the art of the sport.
<br>
<br>
Remises and stop-cuts would not normally score a point as a hit by the attacker would take priority. However the hit made with priority may arrive too late under the shorter timings to register, and so the stop-cuts and remises would indeed score.
<br>
<br>
As a result of the narrower timings, the efficacy of attacks into preparation was increased, meaning that it was now more critical that the preparing fencer must already have begun an attack by the time the two fencers were in hitting distance of each other.
<br>
<br>
The techniques of how to parry and riposte have been extended. The solid parries, used extensively before the change of timings, would be supplemented by an additional step back by the defender to avoid the attacker remising (continuing to push their blade after their attack has technically done) or else the defence to be performed as a beat-attack, an extending arm that deflects the oncoming attack halfway through the extension before hitting the original attacker's target area.
<br>
<br>
With hindsight, the shorter timings seem to have encouraged a tightening and refinement of the original techniques with smaller, neater moves so that, on the whole, sabre fencing became faster and more precise than it had ever been before.

<h3>Right of Way</h3>
<div id="image">
  <img src="https://brianko03.github.io/images/sabrelunge.jpg" alt="Sabre Fencing" style="width:400px;height:auto;">
</div>
<p>When both lights turn on, it rests upon the referee to decide which fencer scores the point. The decision is based on the concept of Right of Way (RoW) which gives the point to the fencer who had priority, i.e. the attacking fencer. As with foil, the other RoW weapon, priority is gained in many ways, which can be broken down into active, passive, and defensive categories:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Active:</strong>
<br>
<br>
Attacking the opponent. (In fencing the word "attack" is defined as: the initial offensive action made by extending the arm and continuously threatening the opponent‘s target, preceding the launching of the lunge or step. The flèche is illegal in sabre as a "crossover". In sabre the threat may be established with the point or the cutting edge, and the end of the attack coincides with the moment the front foot touches the strip). Hitting with the blade after the front foot has landed constitutes a remise of the attack, and so an opponent's attack delivered at the same time would take the RoW in this case.
<br>
<br>
Executing an attack which is preceded by a beat on the opponent's weapon.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Passive:</strong>
Establishing a point in line prior to the opponent initiating an attack. The hit must be completed with the point. Derobement of the opponent's attempts to beat are allowed, but the point must continue to threaten the target, and a derobement when there is no attempt to beat also loses the right of way.
<br>
<br>
If an attack is executed against an opponent who has point in line, the attacker must remove the point in line (i.e., with a beat, etc.). Simply making contact with the blade is insufficient and the blade must actually be moved aside.
<br>
<br>
If an attempt to beat the blade is made, and missed (because of a derobe), the opponent maintains the right of way.
<br>
<br>
Point in line retains priority regardless of whether the fencer is advancing, stationary, or retreating, but is lost if arm is bent or the point is moved away from targeting the opponent.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Defensive:</strong>
<br>
<br>
Executing an immediate return offense following the opponent's failed attack; the failed attack can be the result of a parry (i.e., parry-riposte), or because it has fallen short of the target (commonly termed a "get-away-go"), or in any other way missed.
<br>
<br>
If neither fencer has RoW in a double touch situation (typically, if both initiate the attack simultaneously in so far as the director can determine), the action is called a "simultaneous attack" and no point is awarded.
<br>
<br>
RoW rules were initially established to encourage fencers to use parries and other techniques in order to hit without being hit, as they would logically desire to do if they were using sharp swords. Subsequently, the rules of RoW have been altered simply to keep the strategy and technique of sabre interesting and (relatively) easy to understand.
