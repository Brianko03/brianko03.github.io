  <p>Fencing is a unique sport in which two competitors battle each other using a "rapier" type blade. All point is scored through contact with the blade. Fencing was one of the first sports to be incorporated into the Olympics. Below is a video that shows two very high-level fencers fencing for the Gold Medal in the 2015 World Cup.</p>

  <p>There are three forms of fencing: fleur, épée, and sabre. Each has its own sets of rules and weapons. Most competitors specialize in one form only. The table below presents a brief description of what each form of fencing is like:</p>
  <table id="shorten">
    <tr>
      <th>Fleur</th>
      <th>Sabre</th>
      <th>Épée</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Fleur is a type of fencing that has the most set of rules (very picky ones too). The only scoring method is by "stabbing" the opponent. In fleur, the ideal target area is the torso, back, and the lower half of the head. If any where else is hit, the box will indicate a white light, meaning that it was "off target." This is registered by a button at the end of the blade, which measures the pressure put on the point.</td>
      <td>Sabre is another form of fencing, where a point is registered by both poking and slashing the opponent. The target area is slightly larger than fleur, for it includes the entire mask for slashing and the glove as well. Sabre requires the most speed out of all three forms, because speed is a crucial factor in being able to block the opponent's slashes while trying to figure out how to attack the opponent.</td>
      <td>Épée, the third form of fencing, is a unique form of fencing that has a very simple set of rules: get the light on, and you get a point. There are no white lights in épée, because the entire body is the target. This means that it is a valid strategy to go for the foot, where there is close to no defense. The unique thing about this form of sport is that it is possible to get a "double-touch," where both fencers will be awarded a point. This only happens if both of them hit each other almost instantaneously, without delay.

 <p>Fencing is governed by the Fédération Internationale d'Escrime, also known as FIE. The FIE is composed of 145 national federations, meaning that all 145 countries recognize the sport of fencing.
  <br>
  Fencing has very complicated rules, and it is all stored in the rule book which is used in all FIE sanctioned international events. This includes world cups, world championships, and the Olympics. The United States has a different set of rules which is governed by the USFA (United States Fencing Association), but the USFA rules generally adhere to the FIE standards.</p>
  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>The earliest roots of fencing started as self-defense and duels. It is believed to have originated from Spain. The transition into a sport is believed to have started when a fencing school was set up by a man named Dominico Angelo. This school dominated the art of fencing for almost a century by running for three generations of the family. Up until the 1930s, they had to use judges, because the electric apparatus had not been integrated into the sport. Because of this, there were a lot of judge bias, because the judges had to decide whether the blade hit the target or not just with their eyes. The first scoring boxes displayed a red or green tone, with an audible tone. This permitted more accurate scoring and faster actions, lighter touches, and more touches to the back or the flank (under the arm of the weapon).

  <h2>Protective Clothing</h2>
  <p>There are a lot of general protective gear that is worn for fencing. Some of the gears include:</p>
  <ul id="indexlist">
    <li id="listindex">Mask</li>
    <li id="listindex">Jacket</li>
    <li id="listindex">Glove</li>
    <li id="listindex">Underarm</li>
    <li id="listindex">Knickers</li>
    <li id="listindex">Chest Protector (optional for men)</li>
  </ul>

  </div>
  <div class="right">
    <p>All of the equipment listed are required at every fencing tournament, except for the chest protector, which are required only for girls. The mask cannot have any seams that are torn apart. Also, the mask is checked by a thick needle which is not designed to pierce the design of the mask. Once it goes through, the direction of the mask arrays are designed so that the needle is pushed back out. If the needle stays stuck in the mask, then it will not pass the test. Foil and sabre masks must also pass the bib test, meaning that the electric current must flow correctly through the bib of the mask. If there is a "dead spot," meaning it doesn't transfer the electricity correctly and shows a white light where it's supposed to show a valid light, then it will not pass as well. After the equipments are checked, the inspector will put either a stamp, or a special kind of indicator tape on the equipment, meaning that is passed. When the referee checks everyone's equipment again, the referee must look for the mark showing that they passed the inspection. The most commonly checked are masks and gloves, body cords, mask cords, and lámes (only in foil and sabre).</p>

  <h3>USFA</h3>
  <p>The United States Fencing Association, also known as the USFA, is responsible for organizing all of the tournaments within the United States. They are responsible for hosting all the national level tournaments such as summer nationals. Also, it is responsible for checking all of the ratings fencers have earned, by checking the tournament and its validity of it. The USFA website has all the necessary information for tournaments events and many other things. The link is shown below:</p>
