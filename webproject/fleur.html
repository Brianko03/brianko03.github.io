    <p>Fleur, also referred to as foil, is the form of fencing that requires the most rules. The target area is the most limited, for it only allows the front and back torso area, and a tiny bit of the mask called the bib. The only method of scoring is by stabbing the opponent, meaning that the lights won't turn on if you attempt to slash the opponent or use any other method of contact.</p>

    <p>The weapon itself is made of tempered and annealed low-carbon steel, which is flexible and weighs about 350 grams. The assembled blade is 110 centimeters, with the actual blade being no more than 90 centimeters. After the blade, there is the bell guard, which provides a border between the grip and the blade. Next to the grip, there is a socket where you would put the body cord in, to connect the sword from the "electric reel" that allows you to fence electric. The circuit within the blade is always a "closed" circuit, meaning at rest there is a complete power circuit, until when the blade is depressed. If it is depressed, then the blade shows the appropriate light based on the target area. The target area is shown in the picture below:</p>

      <h2>Rules</h2>
    <h3>Right of Way</h3>
    <p>The most complicated factor about foil is that it has a special type of rule called right of way. Right of way determines who gets the touch, in case both lights are simultaneously turned on. At the start of the bout, the person who advances first receives the right of way. However, if at any point of time the advancing person stops his movement or backs up, he/she instantly loses the right of way and the opponent receives it instantly. Another way of losing right of way is by contact. If the person advancing is "parried," meaning blocked, by the other person's blade, the opponent gets the right of way. The only exception is when the person attacking hits the blade at the exact moment, where in which, it is called a "beat." Beat parries have priority over a regular parry on defense, meaning that the attacker still maintains his/her right of way. 
    <br>
    If the person who is defending does not attempt to retake right of way, he will always lose the touch if the person attacking manages to get a light on. Even if the person attacking puts a white light on and the defender gets a valid touch, the person attacking will still get the right of way, and the bout will continue where the fencers stopped. The only time the defender will get the touch without parrying is by not letting the attacker hit you, while successfully hitting the opponent. This is called a "counterattack," where you land a touch while the attacker misses or is not ready to hit. This is a very dangerous touch, for if the attacker manages to get a light on, then this will mean that you will lose the action. Touches like these which require the accurate decisions of a referee can lead to many arguments during the bout.</p>
    <h3>Scoring</h3>

    <p>The foil is used as a thrusting (or point) weapon only. Contact with the side of the blade (a slap or slash) does not result in a score. The tip of the foil must be depressed for 15 (± 1) milliseconds while in contact with the opponent's lamé (wire-mesh jacket which covers valid target area) to score a touch. The tip must be able to support a minimum force of 4.90 newtons (500 grams-force) without the circuit breaking. This is tested with a 500g (± 3g) weight.</p>
