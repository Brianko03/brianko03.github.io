    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Tournaments are hosted all over the United States. Tournaments are divided by the three different fencing sports, and also by gender. Men and women are almost always divided, except in very local events when there are not enough members on each gender side.
    <br>
    <br>
    The link below is the official FIE website, which has all the information needed in order to be a fencer, such as the rule books, equipement requirements, and so on.</p>

    <h2>Tournament Format</h2>

    </div>
    <p>All tournaments will have a preliminary round, called pools. In pools, you will be divided up into 6 or 7 people per pool, and you will get to fence every one in the pool, to a game of 5. The number of wins, points scored, and points you got scored on will all be calculated and set up for the final result for the Direct Elimination Round. In the Direct Elimination Round, you go to a game of 15, and once you lose, you are eliminated from the tournament.
    <br>
    <br>
    The indicator is the number of points scored subtracted from the points you received. The indicator is the determining factor for seeding for the Direct Elimination. However, the more crucial factor is the number of wins you have. Even if you have a higher indicator than the person who won more games than you, you will be placed lower because the number of games won is more important. If you do well in the pools, you might get a bypass, meaning that you do not fence anyone in the first round. Bypasses are given out to the fencer so that there will be an even tournament, where it is a perfect tournament, with no one left out. The number of bypasses given out is the number of fencers subtracted from the next power of 2 that is greater than the number of fencers. For example, in a tournament with 100 people, the next greater value than 100 that is a power of 2 is 128. This means that there will be 28 bypasses given out, which allow the top 28 people to skip to the Round of 64. Below is an example of a sample Direct Elimination Table:</p>

    <h2>Types of Tournaments</h2>
    <p>There are many types of tournaments. Most of them are based on the age groups. The table below shows the different fencing tournaments and their requirements:</p>

    <br>
    <p>You may be wondering what the "class" column might be. The letters, A, B, C, D, E, and U are called ratings. Ratings are determined by many factors: how many people come to the tournament, how many fencers of each rating are coming, and how well the rated fencers do in the tournament. Based on all of the requirements, the tournament is rated a certain level. The harder the tournament is, the rating of the tournament goes up, where it gets to the hardest tournament, which is an <strong>A4</strong> event.
    <br>
    Fencers are rated as well. The better fencers are crowded more to the A, B, area, while decent fencers are usually rated D and C. Beginners and novices are usually earn about E and U. The rating depends on what type of tournament you attend and how well you do. For example, for a hard A4 event, at least 64 people must attend, where at least 12 fencers must be rated A, 12 fencers must be rated B, and 12 fencers must be rated C. Not only that, the fencers have to FINISH in high places as well. 4 A's or more must finish in the top 8 on the tournament, and another 4 B's (or higher) must finish in the top 12th place in the tournament. If they do not meet the requirements, then this means that the tournament is invalid and the number and type of ratings given to the people are going to be decreased. If the tournaments are done exactly as followed, then the top 8 places will get the rating A, 9-16th place will get Bs, 17th to 24th will get Cs, 25th-32th will get Ds and finally 33th-48th will get Es.
    <br>
    The rating matters in tournaments, because of the seeding. If you have a higher rating than another person, you will be seeded higher than them. If you are seeded higher, you will be put up with easier opponents in the pools, which will allow you to do a better job in the entire tournament. The ratings are expressed in 3 values. The first value is a letter, which indicates your rating. The second and third are the year you got your rating in. For example, if someone got their A in 2016, it will be indicated as "A16." This is because ratings only last for two years until it expires. The fencer must renew the rating in order to maintain their current rating or go to a higher one.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Replays</h2>
    <p>In national tournaments, "replays" are available. Replays are available to very high-intensity matches, just in case the referee makes a mistake. If a fencer feels that the referee made a bad call, he can draw an imaginary rectangle with both of his hands indicating a replay. The referee will then go to the replay table, and check the footage that just happened. Then, he will either change his mind or go with his decision. The fencer gets 2 replays every bout, but if the referee changes his mind in any way other than the call he just made, you get the keep the replay. However, if he stays with his decision, you lose the replay, and you will only have one more chance to ask for a replay. Replays are not available on every bout. It is only available in the top-notch matches, which is usually the top 16 and up.</p>
    <h2>Equipment Checks</h2>
    <p>At the start of every tournament, the fencer must get their equipment inspected and passed. If an equipment does not pass, the fencer must have an extra for it or he/she will not be eligible to fence in the tournament. Usually, there are vendors who sell the equipment on-site, especially if it is a huge tournament. In local tournaments, they are not as strict as national levels, which means that they won't check everything a national tournament may check.</p>
    <h3>Sources</h3>
    <p>In order to check the information about the tournaments about you, you can use the askFRED data base, which stands for ask Fencing Results and Events Database. This shows all the results, upcoming events and their location, and the preregistration status of the fencer. This is a good source for preregistering for tournaments which are required for some tournaments, and also checking who else is going and what level the tournament is going to be.
